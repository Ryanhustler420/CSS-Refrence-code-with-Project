See the previous lecture - the course outline - for more information.</p><ul><li>Dive into our "<strong>Advanced Track</strong>": If you already got <strong>basic CSS knowledge</strong>, you can start the course in <strong>module 7 (Background &amp; Images)</strong>.</li><li>Dive into our "<strong>Expert Track</strong>": If you already got <strong>advanced CSS knowledge</strong>, you may start right with <strong>Flexbox - module 13</strong>.</li><li>If none of the above applies, you simply continue with module 2 :)</li></ul>
